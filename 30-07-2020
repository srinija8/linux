Monitor the system resources = 
Resources = cpu, memory, swap, process, devices,network.
Monitoring system resources and reporting their utilization are important system admin tasks.
monitoring resource tools are = 
vmstat 		: 	reports virtual memory statistics
iostat 		: 	reports cpu, device and partition statistics
mpstat 		: 	reports activities for each available cpu
nfsiostat	: 	it reports read and write operations on NFS
cifsiostat	:	it reports read and write operations on CIFS
pidstat		:	reports statistics for running process
sar		:	system activities reports
sadf		:	display the data gathered in various format
dstat		:	cpu,disk,network,paging and system statistics= more powerful tool than 				vmstat &iostat 
top		: 	dynamic output	
pgrep		:	grep the process from ps tables
netstat		:	network statistics
ss		:	network statistics
nmap		:	remote machine network statistics
ps		:	process status
we have to install the package to perform all these tasks:commands to be exacuted
200#yum install sysstat –y
Sadf:
201#vim /etc/sysconfig/sysstat 
202#sadf -s 09:00:00 -e 17:00:00 /var/log/sa/sa16 | more
203#sadf -d /var/log/sa/sa20 -- -urd -n DEV
d-report block devices, u- cpu usage, r-memory usage, n- network devices
204#cd /var/log/sa
205#ls   
Dstat:   
Displays system resource statistics 
m-Memory, d-disk, n-network, c- cpu , g-reports paging , y-system statistics, s-swap space, p-process statistics, r-read/write statistics
commands:
  295  yum install dstat -y
  296  dstat -cdmn
  297  dstat –gyprs
Vmstat:
It reports virtual memory statistics
It reports process, memory, swap, paging, blockIO, disk statistics.
After executing this command, it reports average details since last reboot.
Process== r-no of runnable process, b-uninterrupted sleep process, swapd-amount of virtual memory used, 
Memory== free-amount of idle memory, buff-amount of space for buffer, cache-cache memory, 
swap== si-swap input how much memory you are reading from disk, so-swap output-how much memory you are writing into disk, bi,bo-block in & blockout, in=how many interrupts per second, cs-no of context switching per second, 
cpu== us-user time, sy-how much time you are spending on kernel code, id-how much time system is in idle value, wa-waiting time-looking for input/output, st-steal value-how much amount of memory stolen from virtual machine.
Iostat =
User and nice value come for non kernel code.
It reports system i/o statistics for devices and partitions.
Every 3 seconds output will be displayed for iostat.
Commands:
#iostat
#iostat 3
#iostat 3 5
Mpstat =
It is a linux command. It is an utility. Collects and displays information about cpu utilization and performance statistics. If you want to accurately measure cpu utilization.
We will use processes and cpu utilization dynamically we use `top` command.
#mpstat
#mpstat 2 5
#mpstat –P 1  === processor 1 info
#mpstat –P 2  === processor 2 info
Pidstat =
This tool reports statistics of cpu used by a process and disk usage statistics of a process.
It will take only running processed.
#pidstat –p ALL == all the processed
#pidstat –p 5403
#pidstat –C “vsftpd”  ==command to display statistics of vsftpd process, c- command/canonical name 
#pidstat –p 15 –d 1 5 == d-disk usage and 1 is every one second interval and 5 outputs.
Pgrep= It will display pid of all running processes.
#pgrep 
#pgrep vsftpd
#pgrep vsftpd –l
#pgrep –u root    == #pgrep –u username
#pgrep –u username1 , username 2
#pgrep –u root,srinija       #pgrep –u username1 , username 2
#pgrep –c –u root,Srinija   == #pgrep –c –u username   c=count,u=userl=list process id and process name
ss= Display the listening and non-listening ports
#ss –a  == all the ports both listening and non-listening 
#ss –l   == only listening ports in your server
#ss –t  == tcp ports
#ss –u == udp ports
#ss –ua == all udp ports
#ss –lu == all listening udp ports
#ss –lt == only listening tcp ports
#ss –la == all tcp ports
#ss –p == process id of ports
Nfsiostat = report input and output statistics for network file systems (NFS)
#nfsiostat

Cifsiostat = reports CIFS statistics.
#cifsiostat
